## Contributing

If you want to contribute don't hesitate. Just follow these steps:

* Fork this repository
* Create a new branch
* Make your changes on the new branch
* Pull request to the development branch (_currently [v2](https://github.com/BayGamerYT/Fortnite-Data/tree/dev)_)

I recommend making an [issue](https://github.com/BayGamerYT/LobbyBot/issues) to discuss beforehand whether or not changes are needed in what you want to contribute.
